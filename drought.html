<h1>Mid-Missouri farmers fight drought with hope in sustainability</h1>
<p class="byline">By Amy Schaffer and Cara Penquite</p>
<p>According to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, almost 95% of Missouri counties are in a drought. While images of searing hot weather and summertime conditions might come to mind with the word “drought,” farmers in mid-Missouri do not get a break from the challenges the drought brings during the colder seasons. The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration says that most of mid-Missouri is predicted to be in the “drought remains but improves” category until January of 2024. We talked to local farmers using sustainable farming techniques and drought mitigation practices to take care of the environment and help ensure the future of their livelihoods.</p>

<p>Driving along crunching gravel roads in rural Missouri, it's common to pass by fields of cattle. But just visible from the road in Kirksville, Missouri is Cheha Ranch, where bison roam and tall prairie grasses bloom, reminiscent of Missouri wildlife from decades past.</p>

<p>Cheha Ranch co-owner Allan Perry does what he can to give back to the land and has not missed the benefits.</p>

<p>“Our goal is just to try to find a way to be successful in agriculture without destroying the ecosystem or the environment,” Allan said. “That's why we went with the bison and the warm season grasses because you kind of bring back how the land was.”</p>

<p>Native Missouri prairie plants grow long roots that dig deeper into the ground than cool season grasses – which are the typical choice for cattle farmers. Cheha Ranch co-owner Hannah Perry explained that these long roots saved their grasses during the drought.</p>

<p>“The cool season grasses weren't growing at all and the warm season was fine this summer,” Hannah said. “So that's how we could continue to feed our animals as we still had our grass.”</p>

<p>Even with more diverse prairie grasses, they usually have to start feeding their bison and cattle hay starting around Thanksgiving. This year, they started feeding their animals hay halfway through October.</p>
